# persona_python
App for keeping stats of border crossing

This app was created in August 2014. This is a software written using Python, PyQt and SQLite
for keeping stats of border crossing for government agencies. It has a russian language
interface, and I am not planning to internalizate it.

Installing:
  - launch create_database.py (this will create SQLite persona.db file)
  - launch insert_admin.py (this will add credits for admin)

Login: admin

Password: 111

You may change this before launching insert_admin.py

Requirements: Python v3.3.5+
App also has russian readme
